# Stembase
## File management and tagging Tools base on electron framework
This is a simple tagging system and file management system and present a solution for any people seeking a better way to manage their stuff, or learning some basic Javascript tagging system building.

#This system can do
- Add tag to your file
- Search and list file by tag or by file name
- Create monitored groups for quick access or sorting (Support folder or file even monitored groups)
- Basic data information display
- Multiple floors of file exploring
- Simple and intuitive operation same as your original OS
- Different context menu for different case 
- and more will be added

-----------------
The first stage of this system is almost complete, after some minor patches will be a official release (or unstable pre-release?).
However, I have to focus on my other project https://github.com/Paiiimannnoitla/General-Affairs-Server(General Affarirs Server,GAS) for job testing project sake.
This project is not abandoned, I will be back in 2 weekes.\
-- sincerely, Paiiimannnoitla
